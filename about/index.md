Hey! I'm **L**ucas **C**oelho (which means **rabbit** in english), or **lcrabbit**, I'm a 19 years old programmer and IT student, and this is my site, where I'm going to publish some articles/texts about what I'm working on, projects, studies, or whatever. It's like my personal "blogfolio" (some blog and portfolio's fusion).

You can check my [github profile here](https://github.com/lcrabbit).
