# Brief Description
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), is a minimal, readable format for structuring data based on JavaScript's object literal notation. We're going to see how to use it to serialize information [read about serialization here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization), in this case, I'll show you how to make a localization system using the JSON format as an example of this on gamedevelopment. I'll be using Godot, but it's something totally adaptable for other engines/frameworks.

**Application Examples**

1. Save/Load system
2. Localization/Multi Language support
